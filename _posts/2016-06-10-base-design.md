title: Base Design

The MagniCube is supposed to have a base which can hold a 9V block battery. 
My first attempt designing a FDM printable socket didn't turn out too well.

The outside walls turned out to be too thin and floppy.

My second attempt turned out better.

I also experimented with an imprint.

I still need to work on the quality of my 3D prints, though.
